Hello! My name is Kedree Proffitt, and I was a dual major at the University of Michigan Flint pursuing Physics. I am currently a PhD student in Medical Physics at Wayne State University. I enjoy using technology to make the surreptitious kernels of knowledge that hide in plain sight more obvious. By using data analytics and a deep understanding of our topic, we can solve any problem that crosses our path.

Here are some highlights of some interesting projects I have undertaken:

**Radionuclide Physics Teaching (RT4220 Wayne State)**

Taught 11 students radionuclide physics (among other basic medical physics concepts) with original lectures and post-lecture assignments. Unfortunately, my hands were tied in creating new exams, so I was forced to use the previous lecturer's work with slight modification (no change in content). I am very proud of myself and my students, physics is not their forte! They all passed with flying colors, an A- median! I think that the following _thank you_ letter that I received speaks for itself:

**Data Analytics**
* Near Earth Objects (CSC 302 Final and Pet Project for Weeks)
    * Obtained asteroid and meteorite data from NASA's database API
    * Cleaned the data to include only relevant near-earth data
    * Combined this with other NASA close approach data to create a stronger data set with more information on each asteroid
    * Created many figures with some help from classmates, but I am most proud of this image, which was made by myself only. More info is available in my DataAnalysisUMF repo

* Used Car Data (CSC 302 Midterm)
    * Obtained data on used cars in the US via Kaggle
    * Cleaned the data and tried to extract some useful insights
    * With a limited dataset, it was quite hard to find useful information, but out came a garish figure that I *was* proud of at the time, improvement is good!

* Many more Data Analytics Projects to come!

**Physics**
* Hamiltonian Time Evolution Graph (Research assistant work for UM-Flint quantum computation UROP)
    * Our research team started with a Hamiltonian for a quantum system, and using Qiskit and Python data analytics tools like Seaborn, we created a graph for each state's probabilities over time

* Electricity and Magnetism Dual Opposite Ring Charge Electric Field Calculator along Z Axis with GUI
    * This was my Electricity and Magnetism first Lab, we were offered a new choice, our teacher was testing out, do the old PHET simulation labs, or do something interesting, a computational project...
    * He tested the waters of our abilities by asking us to do the above calculation theoretically and then do it numerically, as it's my first EVER GUI, it's pretty basic.
    * This was written in Python, and with the help of Qt Designer, I made the GUI. Much of the calculation was done in Python, and the equations were derived on whiteboards and using Mathematica.
